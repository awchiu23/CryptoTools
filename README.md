# CryptoTools
I have created these tools for my own crypto arbitrage trading activities.  Enjoy!

## CryptoLib.Py
- Replace the defaults with your own API keys.

## Crypto Alerter
- This tool is for monitoring premium/discounts as well as funding rates.
- For the purpose of calculating premium/discount%, the spot prices from FTX are used.  This is assuming that you will trade your spot on FTX.

## Crypto Reporter
- This tool is for monitoring your NAVs and positions.

## Crypto Trader
- This tool is for machine trading on the exchanges.
- For reference only--use at your own risk!
